Theme 'Material' - 2023-03-13 by Lilbud
based on simple(c) Nils Bonenberger - nilsbyte@nilsbyte.de - http://blog.nilsbyte.de/
For use with EmulationStation-DE (https://es-de.org/)

Port of my original Material theme to the new EmulationStation-DE. Thanks to the ES-DE Discord for helping me out with the new theming system. 

Note: The colors are different because I got them from a repository, rather than picking them manually. The original theme only supported like 60 systems, and the default for ES-DE is like 170. So, getting colors for all of them would be far too much.
